### An interesting Article
Here is a link to an article that I find interesting related to software engineering: [The Free Lunch is Over](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm).

### What is interesting about this Article?
Software engineers used to benefit from Moore's law, which states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years. As each generation of processors come with higher clock speeds and higher
straight-line instruction throughput, the performance of software also increases without any effort from the programmers. This has been referred as the "free lunch" for the software engineers in the article above.

However, the effect of free lunch is gradually decreasing since 2002. Due to issues related to hot dissipations, major hardware manufacturers has switched from putting more chip on a single core to multicore. This means, they will not keep up for the performance increase per core but instead use multiple cores to perform computational tasks. As a result, software engineers must be able to write parallelizable code to make the best use of their underlying hardware.
